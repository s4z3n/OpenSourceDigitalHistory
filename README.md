# OpenSourceDigitalHistory
Pulling together FOSS tools to improve the analysis of historical events

This will be an OpenSource based project that will use different types of programing languages, AI, and ML to extract information from primary and secondary source for historical analysis. 

Utilizing the concepts of neural networks powered by AI, I will atempt to show the network of the power structure in 17th century global politics between European sovereignties, the Middle East, and it's relation to the rise of colonialism in the Americas. 

Since this is a new way of analyising data, I am not sure where this project will end up but can say that this is potentially a new way to bridge the gap between history and the digital world. 

Using the concepts of data science without the need to focus on the numbers and instead focus on the connections between historical events.
